# Undertailor

\<insert some nice icon here>

Hey there! This is my game engine project, an engine focused on the stuffs you can do in the Undertale game. If you're up for making a fangame, then look no further! Undertailor can help!

**Undertailor is heavily based on the amazing game by Toby Fox, UNDERTALE. Go check it out [here!](http://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/)**

## What is?

If you didn't get it from the first line, this project is aimed at creating a fully-customizable engine with tools and utilities to help anyone create an Undertale fangame. Of course, you can create something else with the engine, but you'll be on your own for creating base assets from scratch (its unlikely, but possible that the stock assets I create here'll fit with your other game).

Undertailor is **mostly** singlethreaded as of now, and probably pretty inefficient in the stuff it'll try to do (but it'll definitely improve over time!); if you're planning on making something heavier than a small RPG, you might wanna check out other, more professionally-made engines.

## Status

**It's still in an early alpha!**

Right now, Undertailor's in its pretty early stages where I'm still trying to piece together stuffs. You can track what I'm aiming to do by checking this project's issue tracker. That's also where you can give me suggestions and ideas, as well as pass on pull requests to help me make the engine the best it can be.

#### The big things that the engine can do right now...
* **mostly** manage its own overworld

## How to?

Because I've mainly been focused on trying to get the engine to actually work first, there isn't a utility yet that can really help you with things like assets that can be read by the game (its in progress, I swear!). However, you can get a head start on other things; the engine revolves around **Lua scripting.** Lua's a pretty easy-to-learn language, and if you can pick it up in your spare time and get to know what you're messing with, you'll be able to use Undertailor to its full extents!

## Documentation?

Eventually. It's a pretty high priority right now, too; so you won't be waiting that long.

## I wanna help out!

Check out this project's issue tracker! You can send me your suggestions, ideas, and pull requests to help me get more work done! Or if you're not a person who can write Java code that well, that's fine. You can still help by grabbing a current copy of the engine and messing around with it as much as you'd like, and report bugs to me as you find them. Please be sure to search if a bug has already been reported in the issue tracker first; duplicates aren't the best thing to see!

## Who are you?

Just some casual with dreams.

## Afterword

I'd like to say how proud I am of this project; this is the first time I've attempted to build something of this scale and so far, it's going pretty good! Thanks to anyone and everyone who's supported me so far, it helps a lot!
